# Event Logging System

A **scalable**, **tamper-proof**, and **distributed** event logging system designed for robust and decentralized data integrity. Built using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB, the system provides event logging APIs, real-time log verification, and an intuitive UI for log management.

---

## Features
### 1. Tamper-Proof Logging
- Each log entry is cryptographically hashed and linked to the previous log, ensuring immutability.
- Lightweight blockchain-inspired design for log integrity.

### 2. Event Logging API
- RESTful API for logging events, including metadata:
  - **Event Type**
  - **Timestamp**
  - **Source Application ID**
  - **Data Payload (JSON format)**
- APIs for querying logs based on filters like:
  - **Event Type**
  - **Timestamp Range**
  - **Source Application**

### 3. Query and Verification
- **Search Logs**: Filter and paginate large datasets.
- **Integrity Check**: Verify the consistency of logs using cryptographic hashes.

### 4. Scalability
- Designed with **MongoDB sharding** and indexing for high scalability.
- Horizontal scaling for API endpoints.

### 5. User-Friendly Interface
- **Modern UI**: Built with EJS templates for user-friendly log management.
- Pages for:
  - Submitting Logs
  - Querying Logs
  - Verifying Log Integrity

   cd event-logging-system
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure Environment Variables**
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following:
   ```
   MONGO_URI=<your-mongodb-connection-string>
